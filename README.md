# Radiomics machine learning study with a small sample size: Single random training-test set split may lead to unreliable results

## Four datasets
1. GBM vs. Metastasis, without undersampling: "GvM_cohort.csv"
2. GBM vs. Metastasis, with undersampling: "GvM_cohort_undersampled.csv"
3. Low- vs. High-grade meningioma, without undersampling: "MEN_cohort.csv"
4. Low- vs. High-grade meningioma, with undersampling: "MEN_cohort_undersampled.csv"
